things to work on:
Missing values:
Lot Frontage - can either fill with mean, median or use MICE
Electrical - fill with the most common
BsmtFinType2 - estimate based on the mean of the same type in BsmtFinType1, fill as Rec since mean and median is similar to the area value
BsmtExposure - fill in "No" for id 949
MasVnrArea fill 0 if MasVnrType is NA
MasVnrType fill from exterior1st, exterior2nd, exterqual, ExterCond and see which is closer to the mean

Completed checks:
fireplace and fireplacequ - if quality is na, fireplaces is zero
check BsmtFinSF1 and BsmtFinSF2 if no basements have values - BsmtFinType2 needs to fill 1 missing value
BsmtExposure needs to fill in missing value - to put as "No" as it is the most common, if there is supposed to be a basement (1 count)
MasVnrArea and MasVnrType needs to fill in some missing values
