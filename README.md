# Kaggle - House Prices Project

This project deals with the house price prediction using the dataset obtained from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques


## Missing values computation

There were some columns with missing values. Imputation was performed on a few columns where the missing value does not have any meaning
As there were more categorical variables that require imputations, categorical variables were imputed first. This was performed using a tree-based algorithm (HistGradientBoostingClassifier)
Following which, the continuous variable(s) were imputed using support vector regression

## Modelling
A multilayer perceptron is used to model the sale price of the flat.
The loss function used for RMSE.
Hyperparameter tuning was performed using Optuna:
- Learning rate - [1e-4, 1e-2]
- Batch size - [2 ** 4, 2 ** 6]
- Optimiser - [Adam, SGD]
- Number of layer - [1, 4]
- Number of neurons in each layer - [1, 3000]
- Activation function - [ReLU, Tanh, Sigmoid]
- Dropout probability - [0.1, 0.5]
- Additional dropout or batch norm layers - [True, False]
